# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We support the latest minor version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please report it privately through GitHub so we can respond and coordinate a fix:

- Use the repository Security tab: https://github.com/ambiyansyah-risyal/golang-base/security
- Or create a private security advisory via: https://github.com/ambiyansyah-risyal/golang-base/security/advisories

When reporting, include:

- Affected versions and components
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce and a minimal proof-of-concept
- Any suggested mitigations (optional)

We will acknowledge reports within 3 business days and coordinate disclosure and remediation. For urgent issues, mark the report as "high" and include contact information for an immediate response.

## Disclosure and Fix Process
We follow coordinated disclosure. After a fix is available, we will publish an advisory describing the issue, impact, and remediation steps.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
